    <h2 class="sub-heading">About Tulsi</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Tulsi Gayatri Mantra is widely spoken during offering water to Tulsi, and is well known and popularly spoken during breathing exercises. Today Moderns Scientists also believe that these mantras are beneficial and proven techniques to improve lung health. Talking about Tulsi, Tulsi was the daughter of “Dharmaraja”-The God of Righteousness. She was a great devotee of Narayan,i.e Lord Vishnu.

    <h2 class="sub-heading">The connection between Tulsi and Lord Ganesha</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Once Tulsi was walking by the Banks of Ganga, she came across the beautiful Ganesha, sitting in Meditation, surrounded by great fragment trees. Tulsi fell in love with Ganesha and requested Ganesha to marry her. Lord Ganesha said he was living the Life of Ascetic(one who dedicates life to the pursuit of contemplative ideals) and cannot think of marriage.</p>
    <p class="post-text">Lord Ganesha only wanted to marry one who possessed the same qualities as her mother Goddess Parvati, Ganesha refused Tulsi politely, but Tulsi took this as an insult and Cursed Ganesha, “One day he(Ganesha) will marry twice against her wish of not married to me(Tulsi)”. Now, the rude behavior of Tulsi revoked the anger of Lord Ganesha, Then Ganesha cursed Tulsi “She will face a misfortune under which she shall marry a demon and suffer under him(demon)”.</p>
    <p class="post-text">Then Tulsi realized her mistake and now prayed to Lord Ganesha. To save her from the curse. Lord Ganesha was pleased and pardoned Tulsi and said, “As per curse she shall marry a demon and then become a plant in her next life, There on Tulsi will be reconganized for her great Medical Properties by all and will become very dear to Lord Vishnu, but Tulsi will unacceptable by me(Ganesha)” Then Tulsi begged Ganesha and later hearing her sincere vibes and prayers, Lord Ganesha agreed that once in a  year tulsi will be offered to him. The occasion will be “Ashwini Shukla Chaturti” also known as “Ganesh Chaturthi” the first day of the 10-day festival. 
    </p>
    <p class="post-text">Later on, Tulsi married a demon king called “Shankachuda”, she was a devoted wife and lived happily, the Demon cant change, Shankachuda has battles with lords and later was killed by Lord Shiva. Then as per the curse, Tulsi took birth as a plant, and no pooja or prayer of Vishnu is completed without offering Tulsi. There is a saying, that Tulsi leaves are offered to dead people, as it is a belief that they will take them to “Vaikunta” 
    </p>
    <p class="post-text">
      Lord Ganesha is known as Vignahara-Remover of Obstacles.
